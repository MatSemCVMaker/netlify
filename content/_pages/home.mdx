    description: >-
      CV is an abbreviation of the Latin words 'curriculum vitae', which mean
      'life course'. A professional CV provides a summary and a good overview of
      someone's life.


      Your CV includes your education(s) and qualifications, work experience, skills, and important qualities. By means of your CV, your potential employer will be able to get a good picture of your skills, work experience, and knowledge quickly, to assess whether or not you fit the job, and therefore whether to offer you a job interview.
